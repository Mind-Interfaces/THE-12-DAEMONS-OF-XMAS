Creating an introductory sequence for a Pygame window for "The 12 Daemons of Xmas" can be an exciting way to set the tone for your game. 

Here's a high-level overview of how you might structure the intro sequence in Pygame, leading up to the title screen reveal:

### Pygame Intro Sequence Overview

1. **Initialize Pygame and Create Game Window**:
   - Set up the Pygame environment and create a game window with dimensions 1280x720.
   - Initialize necessary modules like `pygame.display` and set the window title.

2. **Introductory Scenes**:
   - Develop a series of introductory scenes that set the mood for your game. This could include animations or static images with text overlay that tells a brief story or introduces the game's setting.
   - Use `pygame.time.Clock` to control the timing and transition between scenes.

3. **Christmas Tree Scene**:
   - Design a simple, stylized Christmas tree on a plain black background.
   - This could be a static image or a simple animation created with Pygame's drawing functions.

4. **Explosion Effect**:
   - Create an explosion effect to transition from the Christmas tree scene to the title screen. This could involve particle effects, a sudden burst of light, or a quick animation.
   - Utilize Pygame's animation capabilities to make the explosion dynamic and engaging.

5. **Reveal Title Screen**:
   - After the explosion effect, reveal the title screen for "THE 12 DAEMONS OF XMAS".
   - The title screen should be bold and thematic, capturing the essence of your game. Include options like 'Start Game', 'Options', and 'Exit'.

6. **Event Loop and Transition**:
   - Use Pygame's event loop to keep the game running and handle user input, like pressing a key to move from the title screen to the main game or exit the game.
   - Ensure smooth transitions between different parts of the intro.

### Example Pygame Code Structure

Here's a pseudocode structure to give you an idea of how to implement this in Pygame:

```python
import pygame

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up the display
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1280, 720))
pygame.display.set_caption("The 12 Daemons of Xmas")

# Main game loop
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # Introductory Scenes Logic
    # ...

    # Christmas Tree Scene Logic
    # ...

    # Explosion Effect Logic
    # ...

    # Display Title Screen
    # ...

    # Update the display
    pygame.display.flip()

# Clean up
pygame.quit()
```

This is a basic framework. You'll need to add your custom logic, graphics, and animations to bring the intro sequence to life.

The key is to make the intro engaging and reflective of the game's theme, drawing players into the world of "The 12 Daemons of Xmas".
