# Baal Mini Game .. 
# üèóÔ∏è Examination of trust, and the struggle between lust and chastity.
'''
Very well, then let us simplify it even further. 
Instead of choosing truth or dare, players simply answer multiple-choice questions about love and desire. 
Each correct answer earns them a point, while incorrect ones result in a loss. 
Throughout the game, Baal may offer subtle hints via voice prompts to nudge players towards the correct answers. 
However, accepting her assistance comes at the cost of increased difficulty in subsequent questions. 
The goal remains the same ‚Äì accruing enough points before running out altogether. 
This way, even novice players can enjoy exploring the thrill of seduction within the confines of a single-player experience.
